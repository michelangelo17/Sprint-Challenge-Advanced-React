- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

To use state or lifecycle methods for your component. Otherwise a function component should always be used. 

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

ComponentDidMount, used to set up initial data/state for component
ComponentDidUpdate, used to trigger a rerender on state change
ComponentDidUnmount, used to clean up when component dies

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

To allow you to compose multiple hooks together. Similar to HOC. 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Saves time in the long run, prevents mistakes and regressions in our codebase and updates.
